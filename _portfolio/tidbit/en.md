        synthesis_title: By foodies, for foodies
        synthesis: It’s a social network for food lovers that offers personalized restaurant and dish recommendations based on the user's preferences as well as comments and ratings of individual dishes by their friends.
        fun_fact: The first time our client had the initial idea for TidBit Social was during a family dinner, talking about how amazing it would be to access to family and friends' recommendations, so our client wrote some concepts on a napkin, gave some more thought to this idea and TidBit Social was born.

        synthesis_title: Built using agile methodologies
        synthesis: "TidBit Social branding agency did a lot of work defining the look of the app while Turpial, with more experience on UX/UI helped ensure usability and good experience in the design
We worked using agile methodologies with daily standup meetings, planning the work for each iteration and making sure everyone was on the same page and with the same vision."
        fun_fact: Turpial started to work on Tidbit Social in 2016 when Washington, DC-based entrepreneurs came to us with this idea.

        synthesis_title: Ensuring quality
        synthesis: Agile methodologies are always present in our projects and TidBit. We worked with Ionic for a quick-to-market app and Django for the server side, later the mobile app was refactored to React Native. To ensure quality Test Driven Development was practiced in large parts of the project.
        fun_fact: Ionic and React Native are two popular development frameworks used to reuse most of the code, developing apps for different platforms faster and at lower costs
        tools:
            - name: Django
            - name: Ionic
            - name: React Native
