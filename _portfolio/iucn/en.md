        synthesis: "The Red List of Ecosystems of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), is the most extensive initiative documenting the state of conservation of ecosystems worldwide."
        fun_fact: "Proposed during the IV World Congress of Conservation in 2008 and recognized by IUCN in 2014, the LRE is responsible for collecting data, statistics and risk assessment of all the ecosystems of the planet, with the goal of evaluating them all before the year 2025."

        synthesis: "We were contacted by Provita, a Non-governmental organization whose mission is the conservation of endangered species and environments, combining several fields of knowledge in the search for integral solutions. <br>
        One of the most striking aspects of the project is the information tables, aimed to provide the public with summary information regarding the studies and publications carried out worldwide regarding the analysis and preservation of ecosystems. <br>
        Additionally, within the page, there is a form conceptualized by the client, and it can be used by those who evaluate an ecosystem to document the state in which it is located, following the parameters designed by the LRE ecosystem."

        fun_fact: "They can also upload geographic files to provide a georeferenced visual abstraction of the ecosystem within the system."
